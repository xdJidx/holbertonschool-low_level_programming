# C - Makefiles
---------------------------------
## Tasks

0. make -f 0-Makefile  
Create your first Makefile.  
Requirements:  
*name of the executable: school  
*rules: all  
  +The all rule builds your executable  
*variables: none  
```
all :
        gcc main.c school.c -o school
```
1. make -f 1-Makefile  
Requirements:
*name of the executable: school  
*rules: all  
  +The all rule builds your executable
*variables: CC, SRC  
  +CC: the compiler to be used
  +SRC: the .c files
```
CC = gcc
SRC = main.c school.c

all: $(SRC)
        $(CC) $(SRC) -o school
```
2. make -f 2-Makefile  
Create your first useful Makefile.  
Requirements:  
*name of the executable: school  
*rules: all  
  +The all rule builds your executable  
*variables: CC, SRC, OBJ, NAME  
  +CC: the compiler to be used  
  +SRC: the .c files  
  +OBJ: the .o files  
  +NAME: the name of the executable  
*The all rule should recompile only the updated source files  
*You are not allowed to have a list of all the .o files
```
CC = gcc
SRC = main.c school.c
OBJ = $(SRC:.c=.o)
NAME = school

all: $(OBJ)
        $(CC) $(OBJ) -o $(NAME)
```
3. make -f 3-Makefile  
Requirements:  
*name of the executable: school  
*rules: all, clean, oclean, fclean, re  
  +all: builds your executable  
  +clean: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files along with the executable  
  +oclean: deletes the object files  
  +fclean: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files, the executable, and the object files  
  +re: forces recompilation of all source files
*variables: CC, SRC, OBJ, NAME, RM
  +CC: the compiler to be used  
  +SRC: the .c files  
  +OBJ: the .o files  
  +NAME: the name of the executable  
  +RM: the program to delete files  
*The all rule should recompile only the updated source files  
*The clean, oclean, fclean, re rules should never fail  
*You are not allowed to have a list of all the .o files  
```
CC = gcc
SRC = main.c school.c
OBJ = $(SRC:.c=.o)
NAME = school
RM = rm -f

all: $(OBJ)
        $(CC) $(OBJ) -o $(NAME)

clean:
        $(RM) *~ $(NAME)

oclean:
        $(RM) $(OBJ)

fclean: clean oclean

re: fclean all
```
4. A complete Makefile  
Requirements:  
*name of the executable: school  
*rules: all, clean, fclean, oclean, re  
  +all: builds your executable  
  +clean: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files along with the executable  
  +oclean: deletes the object files  
  +fclean: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files, the executable, and the object files  
  +re: forces recompilation of all source files  
*variables: CC, SRC, OBJ, NAME, RM, CFLAGS  
  +CC: the compiler to be used  
  +SRC: the .c files  
  +OBJ: the .o files  
  +NAME: the name of the executable  
  +RM: the program to delete files  
  +CFLAGS: your favorite compiler flags: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic  
*The all rule should recompile only the updated source files  
*The clean, oclean, fclean, re rules should never fail  
*You are not allowed to have a list of all the .o files  
```
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic
SRC = main.c school.c
OBJ = $(SRC:.c=.o)
NAME = school
RM = rm -f

all: $(OBJ)
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(OBJ) -o $(NAME)
clean:
        $(RM) *~ $(NAME)
oclean:
        $(RM) $(OBJ)
fclean: clean oclean
re: fclean all
```
